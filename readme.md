## Amplify-demo app

Welcome to the amplify-demo GitHub project! This project is a demonstration of using the AWS Amplify framework to build a full-stack web application.

The application is a simple notes management tool that allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. It is built using React for the frontend and AWS Amplify for the backend.

Check out the working demo of the app here: https://main.d3o101epuend7x.amplifyapp.com/

I hope you find this demonstration helpful and informative. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to open an issue on this GitHub repository.
